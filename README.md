# VAST-IMA-Player

**VAST-IMA-Player** is a convenience layer around [Google Interactive Media Ads HTML5 SDK](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5) (short: IMA) which tries to make using IMA less cumbersome for common monetization usecases.

This library can be used to build a simple outstream player or it can be used to implement more complex monetization scenarios. VAST-IMA-Player can monetize any content media player (with pre-, mid and postrolls), which follows the browser-built-in [HTMLMediaElement API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement).
